# Header Hero - Development Notes

## Version 1.1.0 Improvements ✅

### Enhanced Scoring System
- **Fixed CSP-Report-Only handling**: Now properly recognizes and scores CSP-Report-Only headers (60% of enforcing score)
- **Smart X-XSS-Protection scoring**: Contextual analysis - high scores when disabled but CSP is present
- **Weighted header importance**: More realistic scoring based on actual security impact
- **HTTPS-aware HSTS scoring**: Partial credit for sites already using HTTPS

### Score Calculation Details
```
Total possible: 100 points
- Content-Security-Policy: 30 points (most critical)
- CSP-Report-Only: 20 points (monitoring value)  
- HSTS: 15 points (transport security)
- X-Frame-Options: 15 points (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options: 10 points (MIME protection)
- Referrer-Policy: 5 points (privacy)
- X-XSS-Protection: 3 points (legacy protection)
- Permissions-Policy: 2 points (modern feature control)
```

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced error handling with 10-second timeouts
- Better CSP analysis (unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval penalties, nonce bonuses)
- Improved TypeScript compliance and type safety
- Added Mozilla.org as test example (security-focused org)

### Testing Results
- **Google.com**: Now scores ~45-55% (realistic for CSP-Report-Only setup)
- **GitHub.com**: Should score 85-95% (comprehensive security headers)
- **Mozilla.org**: Good baseline security implementation

## Production Ready ✅
- Clean TypeScript compilation
- Next.js 15 optimization
- Responsive UI with proper loading states
- Server-side header fetching with error handling

## Next Steps (Future Versions)
- [ ] Add more security headers (Cross-Origin policies)
- [ ] Historical tracking of scores
- [ ] Batch analysis for multiple URLs
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF/JSON reports)
- [ ] Integration with security scanning APIs
