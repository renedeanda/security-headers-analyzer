# Header Hero üõ°Ô∏è

Header Hero is a web-based tool designed to help developers quickly understand and analyze HTTP security headers for any website. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes 8 key security headers including:
  - `Content-Security-Policy` & `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Frame-Options`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`
  - `Referrer-Policy`
  - `Permissions-Policy`
  - `X-XSS-Protection`

‚úÖ **Smart Scoring System**: 
  - Weighted scoring based on header importance
  - Contextual analysis (e.g., X-XSS-Protection considers CSP presence)
  - Handles CSP-Report-Only headers appropriately
  - Partial credit for HTTPS sites without HSTS

‚úÖ **Security Scoring**: Each header is evaluated as:
  - üü¢ Secure
  - üü° Weak
  - üî¥ Missing

‚úÖ **Educational**: Clear explanations and actionable recommendations for each header

‚úÖ **Modern UI**: Responsive design with visual score indicators and example sites

## Recent Improvements (v1.1)

### Enhanced Scoring Logic
- **CSP-Report-Only Support**: Properly handles and scores Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only headers (60% of enforcing policy score)
- **Contextual X-XSS-Protection**: Smart scoring that gives high marks when XSS protection is disabled but CSP is present
- **Weighted Scoring**: Realistic scoring system that prioritizes critical headers (CSP: 30pts, HSTS: 15pts, etc.)
- **HTTPS Awareness**: Partial credit (60%) for sites using HTTPS even without explicit HSTS header

### Technical Improvements
- 10-second timeout for header fetching
- Enhanced CSP analysis with penalties for unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Added Mozilla.org as example test site
